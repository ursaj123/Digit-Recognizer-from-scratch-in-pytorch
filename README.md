MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision.
+ Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
+ As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

+ In this competition, our goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

I've implemented a neural network model in pytorch for accomplishing this task
